Data Analysis
Pandas Series and DataFrames:
- **Series**: A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type.
- **DataFrame**: A two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types.
- ### Scaler operations on pandas Series/DataFrames:
You can perform various numerical operations on pandas Series and DataFrames. the following are some of the supported scalar operations:
- **Addition**: `+`
- **Subtraction**: `-`
- **Multiplication**: `*`
- **Division**: `/`
- **Modulus**: `%`
- **Exponentiation**: `**`
- Loading and Saving Data:
Pandas facilitates reading data from various file formats (e.g., CSV, Excel, JSON) into DataFrames and saving DataFrames back to these formats.
Exploring Data:
You can explore data by examining the first few rows, checking data types, and getting summary statistics.
Data Cleaning:
Pandas offers tools to handle missing data, remove duplicates, and rename columns, ensuring that your data is clean and consistent.
Data Selection and Filtering:
With Pandas, you can select specific columns, filter data based on conditions, and use logical operators to extract the data you need.
Grouping and Aggregation:
Pandas allows you to group data by one or more columns and perform aggregation operations (e.g., sum, mean) on the grouped data.
Working with Categorical Data:
Pandas provides tools to work with categorical data, including encoding categorical variables and creating dummy variables.
Calculating Correlations:
You can calculate correlations between columns in a DataFrame to identify relationships between variables.
Data Visualization:
You can create basic data visualizations directly with Pandas using built-in plotting functions, making it easier to understand your data.
More Visualization with matplotlib and seaborn:
Pandas can be used in conjunction with other libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create more advanced visualizations.

Seaborn:
Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.
Working with APIs
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow different software applications to communicate with each other. They are used to define the methods for requesting and managing data from a server.

APIs are used to access data from different sources, such as social media platforms, weather services, and financial data providers. The Data is accessed using HTTP requests, and the response could be in different formats, such as JSON, XML, or HTML.

The most commonly used request types are:
- GET: retrieves data from the server.
- POST: sends data to the server.
- Managing API Keys
Some APIs require an API key to access the data. The API key is a unique identifier that is used to authenticate the user. It is important to keep the API key secure and not share it with others.

The API key should never be hardcoded within your application. Instead, it should be stored in a separate file and read from there.
